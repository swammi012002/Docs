# CONNECT A DEVICE

As there are many different IoT hardware available nowadays, this section is divided in different categories: 

**Arduino compatible devices** such as Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino GSM 1400, ESP8266, ESP32, etc. In general, any hardware with Internet connectivity that can be programmed on Arduino IDE.

**Linux** **devices**, including **Raspberry Pi**, or any other Linux computer running Linux or MacOs.
