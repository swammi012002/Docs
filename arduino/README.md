Thinger.io platform is designed to support almost any microcontroller or device with communication capabilities. No matter if it has Ethernet, Wifi, or GSM. Almost any device can be integrated in the cloud. So you can choose the hardware you want to connect, as this platform does not force you to purchase some compatible vendor hardware. This is a crucial when designing your IoT projects. If you have configured your SDK, now it is time to start connecting your device with the default examples.
